## Overview

This repository demonstrates various data analysis techniques including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization
- Drawing actionable conclusions

The main notebook, [`Analysis.ipynb`](./Analysis.ipynb), serves as a complete walkthrough from raw data to insights.

## Features

- 📊 **Comprehensive EDA** using standard Python libraries
- 📈 **Visualizations** for quick and effective communication of findings
- 🧹 **Data cleaning** steps for reproducibility
- 📝 **Well-documented** notebooks for clarity
- 🛠️ **Modular code** for easy adaptation to new datasets

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishav2404/Data-Analysis.git
cd Data-Analysis
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> If requirements.txt is not present, install the main libraries:
> 
> ```bash
> pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
> ```

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

- Open `Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Follow the cells sequentially to understand the data, analysis process, and results.
- Modify the notebook to analyze your own datasets.
